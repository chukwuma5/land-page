## My Challanges and lessons

Learnt how to create a well optimized pictures and svgs for the web with the right sense of color combination, used my fontsizes well, Used my pixels for nice elements that will remain permanent in size as the work goes on. HTML AND CSS was fun working with, and i found out it's better to use the calc property when working with unknown width and properties to get the best results.
